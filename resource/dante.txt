I found myself within a forest dark
For the straightforward pathway had been lost
Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say
Which in the very thought renews the fear
So bitter is it, death is little more
But of the good to treat, which there I found
Speak will I of the other things I saw there
In which I had abandoned the true way
But after I had reached a mountain's foot
At that point where the valley terminated
Which had with consternation pierced my heart
Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders
Vested already with that planet's rays
That in my heart's lake had endured throughout
The night, which I had passed so piteously
Forth issued from the sea upon the shore
Turns to the water perilous and gazes
So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward
Turn itself back to re-behold the pass
Which never yet a living person left
After my weary body I had rested
The way resumed I on the desert slope
And lo! almost where the ascent began
Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!
And never moved she from before my face
Nay, rather did impede so much my way
That many times I to return had turned
And up the sun was mounting with those stars
At first in motion set those beauteous things
A lion's aspect which appeared to me
So that it seemed the air was afraid of him
Seemed to be laden in her meagreness
And many folk has caused to live forlorn!
She brought upon me so much heaviness
With the affright that from her aspect came
That I the hope relinquished of the height
And the time comes that causes him to lose
Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent
E'en such made me that beast withouten peace
Which, coming on against me by degrees
Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent
While I was rushing downward to the lowland
Before mine eyes did one present himself
Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse
When I beheld him in the desert vast
Have pity on me, unto him I cried
He answered me: Not man; man once I was
During the time of false and lying gods
A poet was I, and I sang that just
After that Ilion the superb was burned
Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?
I made response to him with bashful forehead
O, of the other poets honour and light
Avail me the long study and great love
That have impelled me to explore thy volume!
Thou art alone the one from whom I took
The beautiful style that has done honour to me
Behold the beast, for which I have turned back
Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage
For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble
Thee it behoves to take another road
Suffers not any one to pass her way
But so doth harass him, that she destroys him
And has a nature so malign and ruthless
That never doth she glut her greedy will
Many the animals with whom she weds
Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain
He shall not feed on either earth or pelf
'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be
Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour
On whose account the maid Camilla died
Through every city shall he hunt her down
There from whence envy first did let her loose
Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide
And lead thee hence through the eternal place
Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations
Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate
Who cry out each one for the second death
And thou shalt see those who contented are
Within the fire, because they hope to come
Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people
A soul shall be for that than I more worthy
With her at my departure I will leave thee
Wills that through me none come into his city
And I to him: Poet, I thee entreat
By that same God whom thou didst never know
So that I may escape this woe and worse
Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said
That I may see the portal of Saint Peter
Day was departing, and the embrowned air
Released the animals that are on earth
Made myself ready to sustain the war
Which memory that errs not shall retrace
O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!
O memory, that didst write down what I saw
Here thy nobility shall be manifest!
Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient
Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me
To men of intellect unmeet it seems not
In the empyreal heaven as father chosen
The which and what, wishing to speak the truth
Were stablished as the holy place, wherein
Sits the successor of the greatest Peter
Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt
Things did he hear, which the occasion were
To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith
Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it
And by new thoughts doth his intention change
Such I became, upon that dark hillside
Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise
If I have well thy language understood
Replied that shade of the Magnanimous
Thy soul attainted is with cowardice
It turns him back from honoured enterprise
That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension
At the first moment when I grieved for thee
Among those was I who are in suspense
Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star
Of whom the fame still in the world endures
And shall endure, long-lasting as the world
Upon the desert slope is so impeded
Upon his way, that he has turned through terror
That I too late have risen to his succour
And with what needful is for his release
Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go
I come from there, where I would fain return
Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak
When I shall be in presence of my Lord
The human race exceedeth all contained
Within the heaven that has the lesser circles
But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun
The here descending down into this centre
From the vast place thou burnest to return to
Briefly will I relate,' she answered me
Of those things only should one be afraid
Which have the power of doing others harm
Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful
God in his mercy such created me
Nor any flame assails me of this burning
At this impediment, to which I send thee
So that stern judgment there above is broken
In her entreaty she besought Lucia
And said, Thy faithful one now stands in need
Hastened away, and came unto the place
Beatrice said she, the true praise of God
For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?
Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?
Dost thou not see the death that combats him
Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?
To work their weal and to escape their woe
As I, after such words as these were uttered
Came hither downward from my blessed seat
Confiding in thy dignified discourse
Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away
Whereby she made me swifter in my coming
I have delivered thee from that wild beast
Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent
What is it, then?Why, why dost thou delay?
Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?
Daring and hardihood why hast thou not
Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven
And so much good my speech doth promise thee?
Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them
Uplift themselves all open on their stems
Such I became with my exhausted strength
And such good courage to my heart there coursed
That I began, like an intrepid person:
And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon
The words of truth which she addressed to thee!
Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed
That to my first intent I have returned
Now go, for one sole will is in us both
I entered on the deep and savage way
Through me the way among the people lost
Justice incited my sublime Creator
Created me divine Omnipotence
Before me there were no created things
All hope abandon, ye who enter in!
These words in sombre colour I beheld
Written upon the summit of a gate
Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned
All cowardice must needs be here extinct
We to the place have come, where I have told thee
Thou shalt behold the people dolorous
And after he had laid his hand on mine
With joyful mien, whence I was comforted
He led me in among the secret things
There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud
Resounded through the air without a star
Made up a tumult that goes whirling on
Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes
And I, who had my head with horror bound
What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?
Maintain the melancholy souls of those
Who lived withouten infamy or praise
Commingled are they with that caitiff choir
Nor faithful were to God, but were for self
Nor them the nethermore abyss receives
For glory none the damned would have from them
These have no longer any hope of death
No fame of them the world permits to be
And I, who looked again, beheld a banner
Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly
That of all pause it seemed to me indignant
And after it there came so long a train
Of people, that I ne'er would have believed
That ever Death so many had undone
I looked, and I beheld the shade of him
Who made through cowardice the great refusal
These miscreants, who never were alive
By gadflies and by hornets that were there
These did their faces irrigate with blood
Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet
By the disgusting worms was gathered up
People I saw on a great river's bank
That I may know who these are, and what law
As I discern athwart the dusky light
And he to me: These things shall all be known
To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay
Fearing my words might irksome be to him
From speech refrained I till we reached the river
And lo! towards us coming in a boat
Crying: Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!
I come to lead you to the other shore
And thou, that yonder standest, living soul
Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!
He said: By other ways, by other ports
Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage
A lighter vessel needs must carry thee
It is so willed there where is power to do
Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks
Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame
But all those souls who weary were and naked
Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together
As soon as they had heard those cruel words
God they blasphemed and their progenitors
Which waiteth every man who fears not God
Beats with his oar whoever lags behind
As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off
Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils
Throw themselves from that margin one by one
So they depart across the dusky wave
And ere upon the other side they land
My son, the courteous Master said to me
All those who perish in the wrath of God
Here meet together out of every land
And ready are they to pass o'er the river
So that their fear is turned into desire
This way there never passes a good soul
And hence if Charon doth complain of thee
Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports
This being finished, all the dusk champaign
Trembled so violently, that of that terror
The recollection bathes me still with sweat
The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind
And fulminated a vermilion light
Which overmastered in me every sense
And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell
Broke the deep lethargy within my head
A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted
Like to a person who by force is wakened
And round about I moved my rested eyes
Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed
To recognise the place wherein I was
True is it, that upon the verge I found me
That gathers thunder of infinite ululations
So that by fixing on its depths my sight
Let us descend now into the blind world
I will be first, and thou shalt second be
And I, who of his colour was aware
Said: How shall I come, if thou art afraid
Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?
Who are below here in my face depicts
That pity which for terror thou hast taken
Let us go on, for the long way impels us
The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss
Were lamentations none, but only sighs
That tremble made the everlasting air
And this arose from sorrow without torment
Which the crowds had, that many were and great
To me the Master good: Thou dost not ask
Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther
That they sinned not; and if they merit had
In the right manner they adored not God
That without hope we live on in desire
Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard
Began I, with desire of being certain
Came any one by his own merit hence
Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?
And he, who understood my covert speech
Replied: I was a novice in this state
Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent
And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much
And others many, and he made them blessed
And thou must know, that earlier than these
Never were any human spirits saved
But still were passing onward through the forest
The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts
Not very far as yet our way had gone
This side the summit, when I saw a fire
That overcame a hemisphere of darkness
But not so far that I in part discerned not
That honourable people held that place
O thou who honourest every art and science
Who may these be, which such great honour have
That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?
That sounds of them above there in thy life
Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them
In the mean time a voice was heard by me:
All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet
His shade returns again, that was departed
After the voice had ceased and quiet was
Four mighty shades I saw approaching us
Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad
To say to me began my gracious Master:
Who comes before the three, even as their lord
He who comes next is Horace, the satirist
The name that solitary voice proclaimed
Thus I beheld assemble the fair school
Who o'er the others like an eagle soars
They turned to me with signs of salutation
And more of honour still, much more, they did me
In that they made me one of their own band
Thus we went on as far as to the light
Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent
As was the saying of them where I was
We came unto a noble castle's foot
Seven times encompassed with lofty walls
This we passed over even as firm ground
Through portals seven I entered with these Sages
We came into a meadow of fresh verdure
They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices
Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side
Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits
I saw Electra with companions many
On the other side, and saw the King Latinus
Who with Lavinia his daughter sat
When I had lifted up my brows a little
Sit with his philosophic family
Who nearer him before the others stand
Democritus, who puts the world on chance
Of qualities I saw the good collector
Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I
Averroes, who the great Comment made
Because so drives me onward the long theme
That many times the word comes short of fact
Another way my sapient Guide conducts me
And to a place I come where nothing shines
Thus I descended out of the first circle
And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing
Examines the transgressions at the entrance
Judges, and sends according as he girds him
I say, that when the spirit evil-born
Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it
Girds himself with his tail as many times
As grades he wishes it should be thrust down
They go by turns each one unto the judgment
Leaving the practice of so great an office
Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest
Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee
Do not impede his journey fate-ordained
It is so willed there where is power to do
That which is willed; and ask no further question
And now begin the dolesome notes to grow
There where much lamentation strikes upon me
I came into a place mute of all light
Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest
If by opposing winds 't is combated
The infernal hurricane that never rests
Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine
When they arrive before the precipice
There they blaspheme the puissance divine
I understood that unto such a torment
The carnal malefactors were condemned
Who reason subjugate to appetite
And as the wings of starlings bear them on
So doth that blast the spirits maledict
No hope doth comfort them for evermore
And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays
Making in air a long line of themselves
So saw I coming, uttering lamentations
Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress
Thou fain wouldst have, then said he unto me
To sensual vices she was so abandoned
That lustful she made licit in her law
To remove the blame to which she had been led
That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse
She held the land which now the Sultan rules
The next is she who killed herself for love
And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus
Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles
Who at the last hour combated with Love
Shades did he name and point out with his finger
Whom Love had separated from our life
After that I had listened to my Teacher
Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers
Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered
And seem upon the wind to be so light
And, he to me: Thou'lt mark, when they shall be
Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them
By love which leadeth them, and they will come
Soon as the wind in our direction sways them
My voice uplift I: O ye weary souls!
Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it
As turtle-doves, called onward by desire
Fly through the air by their volition borne
So came they from the band where Dido is
Approaching us athwart the air malign
O living creature gracious and benignant
Who visiting goest through the purple air
Us, who have stained the world incarnadine
We would pray unto him to give thee peace
While silent is the wind, as it is now
Sitteth the city, wherein I was born
Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends
To rest in peace with all his retinue
Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize
Seized this man for the person beautiful
That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me
Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving
Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly
Love has conducted us unto one death
Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!
These words were borne along from them to us
As soon as I had heard those souls tormented
I bowed my face, and so long held it down
When I made answer, I began: Alas!
Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!
And I began: Thine agonies, Francesca
Sad and compassionate to weeping make me
But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs
By what and in what manner Love conceded
That you should know your dubious desires?
Than to be mindful of the happy time
In misery, and that thy Teacher knows
But, if to recognise the earliest root
Of love in us thou hast so great desire
One day we reading were for our delight
Full many a time our eyes together drew
That reading, and drove the colour from our faces
But one point only was it that o'ercame us
When as we read of the much-longed-for smile
Being by such a noble lover kissed
This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided
Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating
Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it
That day no farther did we read therein
And all the while one spirit uttered this
The other one did weep so, that, for pity
And fell, even as a dead body falls
At the return of consciousness, that closed
Which utterly with sadness had confused me
New torments I behold, and new tormented
Around me, whichsoever way I move
And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze
Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow
With his three gullets like a dog is barking
Over the people that are there submerged
Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black
And belly large, and armed with claws his hands
He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them
Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs
One side they make a shelter for the other
Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates
When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!
 His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks
 Not a limb had he that was motionless
And my Conductor, with his spans extended
Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled
He threw it into those rapacious gullets
Such as that dog is, who by barking craves
And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws
For to devour it he but thinks and struggles
The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed
Over the souls that they would fain be deaf
We passed across the shadows, which subdues
The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet
Upon their vanity that person seems
They all were lying prone upon the earth
O thou that art conducted through this Hell
He said to me, recall me, if thou canst
And I to him: The anguish which thou hast
Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance
But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful
A place art put, and in such punishment
If some are greater, none is so displeasing
And he to me: Thy city, which is full
Of envy so that now the sack runs over
Held me within it in the life serene
You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco
I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain
For all these suffer the like penalty
I answered him: Ciacco, thy wretchedness
But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come
If any there be just; and the occasion
Tell me why so much discord has assailed it
Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party
Will drive the other out with much offence
Then afterwards behoves it this one fall
Within three suns, and rise again the other
High will it hold its forehead a long while
Keeping the other under heavy burdens
Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled
Here ended he his tearful utterance
And make a gift to me of further speech
And others who on good deeds set their thoughts
For great desire constraineth me to learn
If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom
A different sin downweighs them to the bottom
I pray thee to the mind of others bring me
Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance
Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head
Each one shall find again his dismal tomb
Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure
Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes
So we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture
Touching a little on the future life
Wherefore I said: Master, these torments here
Will they increase after the mighty sentence
And he to me: Return unto thy science
Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is
The more it feels of pleasure and of pain
Albeit that this people maledict
To true perfection never can attain
Round in a circle by that road we went
We came unto the point where the descent is
There we found Plutus the great enemy
Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began
And that benignant Sage, who all things knew
Harm thee; for any power that he may have
Shall not prevent thy going down this crag
Then he turned round unto that bloated lip
And said: Be silent, thou accursed wolf
Consume within thyself with thine own rage
Even as the sails inflated by the wind
Involved together fall when snaps the mast
So fell the cruel monster to the earth
Thus we descended into the fourth chasm
Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore
New toils and sufferings as I beheld?
And why doth our transgression waste us so?
So here the folk must dance their roundelay
Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many
Rolling weights forward by main force of chest
They clashed together, and then at that point
Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde
Crying, Why keepest? and, Why squanderest thou?
Thus they returned along the lurid circle
Shouting their shameful metre evermore
And I, who had my heart pierced as it were
What people these are, and if all were clerks
That there with measure they no spending made
Clearly enough their voices bark it forth
Whene'er they reach the two points of the circle
Where sunders them the opposite defect
Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals
In whom doth Avarice practise its excess
Who were infected with these maladies
And he to me: Vain thought thou entertainest
The undiscerning life which made them sordid
Now makes them unto all discernment dim
Forever shall they come to these two buttings
These from the sepulchre shall rise again
With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn
Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world
Have ta'en from them, and placed them in this scuffle
Whate'er it be, no words adorn I for it
Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce
Of goods that are committed unto Fortune
For all the gold that is beneath the moon
Or ever has been, of these weary souls
Could never make a single one repose
That has the world's goods so within its clutches?
What ignorance is this which doth beset you?
Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her
He whose omniscience everything transcends
The heavens created, and gave who should guide them
That every part to every part may shine
Distributing the light in equal measure
Ordained a general ministress and guide
That she might change at times the empty treasures
Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent
Your knowledge has no counterstand against her
She makes provision, judges, and pursues
Her permutations have not any truce
Necessity makes her precipitate
So often cometh who his turn obtains
Even by those who ought to give her praise
Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute
Among the other primal creatures gladsome
She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices
Let us descend now unto greater woe
Already sinks each star that was ascending
When I set out, and loitering is forbidden
We crossed the circle to the other bank
Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself
Along a gully that runs out of it
The water was more sombre far than perse
Made entrance downward by a path uncouth
A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx
This tristful brooklet, when it has descended
And I, who stood intent upon beholding
Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon
They smote each other not alone with hands
Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth
The souls of those whom anger overcame
And likewise I would have thee know for certain
Beneath the water people are who sigh
And make this water bubble at the surface
As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns
Fixed in the mire they say, 'We sullen were
In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened
Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek
This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats
For with unbroken words they cannot say it
Thus we went circling round the filthy fen
A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp
With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire
Unto the foot of a tower we came at last
We to the foot of that high tower had come
Our eyes went upward to the summit of it
By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there
So far, that hardly could the eye attain it
And, to the sea of all discernment turned
That other fire? and who are they that made it?
What is expected thou canst now discern
If reek of the morass conceal it not
Cord never shot an arrow from itself
That sped away athwart the air so swift
As I beheld a very little boat
Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment
Who shouted, Now art thou arrived, fell soul?
For this once, said my Lord; thou shalt not have us
As he who listens to some great deceit
Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath
My Guide descended down into the boat
The antique prow goes on its way, dividing
While we were running through the dead canal
And said, Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?
But who art thou that hast become so squalid?
And I to him: With weeping and with wailing
Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain
For thee I know, though thou art all defiled
Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat
Saying, Away there with the other dogs!
Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck
He kissed my face, and said: Disdainful soul
Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom
Goodness is none, that decks his memory
Who here shall be like unto swine in mire
Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!
If I could see him soused into this broth
Before we issue forth out of the lake
Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied
Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy
A little after that, I saw such havoc
Made of him by the people of the mire
And that exasperate spirit Florentine
Turned round upon himself with his own teeth
But on mine ears there smote a lamentation
Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes
The city draweth near whose name is Dis
Within there in the valley I discern
Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire
Then we arrived within the moats profound
That circumvallate that disconsolate city
The walls appeared to me to be of iron
Not without making first a circuit wide
We came unto a place where loud the pilot
Cried out to us, Debark, here is the entrance
More than a thousand at the gates I saw
Were saying, Who is this that without death
Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?
And my sagacious Master made a sign
A little then they quelled their great disdain
And said: Come thou alone, and he begone
Who has so boldly entered these dominions
Let him return alone by his mad road
Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain
Who hast escorted him through such dark regions
At utterance of the accursed words
Hast rendered me security, and drawn me
From imminent peril that before me stood
Let us retrace our steps together swiftly
Said unto me: Fear not; because our passage
None can take from us, it by Such is given
But here await me, and thy weary spirit
Comfort and nourish with a better hope
For in this nether world I will not leave thee
My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt
For No and Yes within my head contend
Ere each within in rivalry ran back
They closed the portals, those our adversaries
On my Lord's breast, who had remained without
And turned to me with footsteps far between
His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he
Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs
Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?
Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial
Whatever for defence within be planned
For once they used it at less secret gate
Which finds itself without a fastening still
O'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription
And now this side of it descends the steep
Passing across the circles without escort
One by whose means the city shall be opened
That hue which cowardice brought out on me
Beholding my Conductor backward turn
Sooner repressed within him his new colour
He stopped attentive, like a man who listens
Because the eye could not conduct him far
Still it behoveth us to win the fight
O how I long that some one here arrive!
Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning
But none the less his saying gave me fear
Because I carried out the broken phrase
Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had
Doth any e'er descend from the first grade
Which for its pain has only hope cut off?
This question put I; and he answered me:
Maketh the journey upon which I go
Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho
Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies
Naked of me short while the flesh had been
Before within that wall she made me enter
To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas
Well know I the way; therefore be reassured
Where now we cannot enter without anger
And more he said, but not in mind I have it
Because mine eye had altogether drawn me
Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit
Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen
The three infernal Furies stained with blood
Who had the limbs of women and their mien
Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined
And he who well the handmaids of the Queen
Of everlasting lamentation knew
She who is weeping on the right, Alecto
Tisiphone is between; and then was silent
Each one her breast was rending with her nails
They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud
That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet
Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!
All shouted looking down; in evil hour
Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!
Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut
For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it
Himself, and trusted not unto my hands
O ye who have undistempered intellects
Observe the doctrine that conceals itself
And now there came across the turbid waves
Because of which both of the margins trembled
That smites the forest, and, without restraint
The branches rends, beats down, and bears away
Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb
And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds
Mine eyes he loosed, and said: Direct the nerve
There yonder where that smoke is most intense
Until each one is huddled in the earth
More than a thousand ruined souls I saw
Thus fleeing from before one who on foot
Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet
From off his face he fanned that unctuous air
Waving his left hand oft in front of him
And only with that anguish seemed he weary
And to the Master turned; and he made sign
He reached the gate, and with a little rod
He opened it, for there was no resistance
O banished out of Heaven, people despised!
Thus he began upon the horrid threshold
Whence is this arrogance within you couched?
From which the end can never be cut off
And which has many times increased your pain?
What helpeth it to butt against the fates?
For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled
Then he returned along the miry road
And spake no word to us, but had the look
And we our feet directed tow'rds the city
Within we entered without any contest
And I, who inclination had to see
What the condition such a fortress holds
Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye
And see on every hand an ample plain
That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders
The sepulchres make all the place uneven
So likewise did they there on every side
Saving that there the manner was more bitter
For flames between the sepulchres were scattered
That iron more so asks not any art
All of their coverings uplifted were
And from them issued forth such dire laments
Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented
Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?
And more and less the monuments are heated
And when he to the right had turned, we passed
Now onward goes, along a narrow path
My Master, and I follow at his back
Speak to me, and my longings satisfy
The people who are lying in these tombs
The covers all, and no one keepeth guard
Here with the bodies they have left above
Their cemetery have upon this side
Who with the body mortal make the soul
But in the question thou dost put to me
Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied
From thee my heart, that I may speak the less
Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me
Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place
Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest
Upon a sudden issued forth this sound
From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed
Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader
And unto me he said: Turn thee; what dost thou?
From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him
I had already fixed mine eyes on his
And he uprose erect with breast and front
E'en as if Hell he had in great despite
And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader
Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him
Exclaiming, Let thy words explicit be
As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb
Then asked of me, Who were thine ancestors?
Whereat he raised his brows a little upward
So that two several times I scattered them
If they were banished, they returned on all sides
I answered him, the first time and the second
But yours have not acquired that art aright
Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered
I think that he had risen on his knees
But after his suspicion was all spent
Weeping, he said to me: If through this blind
He who is waiting yonder leads me here
Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had
Already unto me had read his name
When he became aware of some delay
Which I before my answer made, supine
I had remained, did not his aspect change
Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side
And if, continuing his first discourse
They have that art, he said, not learned aright
That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed
But fifty times shall not rekindled be
The countenance of the Lady who reigns here
Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art
Say why that people is so pitiless
Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause
Such orisons in our temple to be made
After his head he with a sigh had shaken
Without a cause had with the others moved
Consented to the laying waste of Florence
He who defended her with open face
I him entreated, solve for me that knot
Which has entangled my conceptions here
Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it
And in the present have another mode
We see, like those who have imperfect sight
The things, he said, that distant are from us
Our intellect, and if none brings it to us
Not anything know we of your human state
Will be our knowledge from the moment when
The portal of the future shall be closed
That still his son is with the living joined
Already of the error you have solved me
Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit
And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not
The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting
Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me
He said to me, Why art thou so bewildered?
And I in his inquiry satisfied him
Let memory preserve what thou hast heard
And now attend here; and he raised his finger
When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet
From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life
Unto the left hand then he turned his feet
We left the wall, and went towards the middle
Along a path that strikes into a valley
Which even up there unpleasant made its stench
Which great rocks broken in a circle made
Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out
We drew ourselves aside behind the cover
Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing
Whom out of the right way Photinus drew
Slow it behoveth our descent to be
So that the sense be first a little used
To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it
Some compensation find, that the time pass not
Began he then to say, are three small circles
From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving
They all are full of spirits maledict
But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee
Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint
Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven
The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them
But since force may be used against three persons
In three rounds 'tis divided and constructed
Use force; I say on them and on their things
As thou shalt hear with reason manifest
Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance
Man may lay violent hands upon himself
Round must perforce without avail repent
Whoever of your world deprives himself
Who games, and dissipates his property
Violence can be done the Deity
In heart denying and blaspheming Him
And by disdaining Nature and her bounty
Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors
And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart
Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung
A man may practise upon him who trusts
And him who doth no confidence imburse
This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers
Only the bond of love which Nature makes
Wherefore within the second circle nestle
Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic
By the other mode, forgotten is that love
From which there is a special faith engendered
This cavern and the people who possess it
But tell me, those within the fat lagoon
Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat
And who encounter with such bitter tongues
Not punished, if God has them in his wrath
And unto me he said: Why wanders so
Thine intellect from that which it is wont?
Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?
Hast thou no recollection of those words
With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses
The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,--
And to thy mind recallest who they are
That up outside are undergoing penance
Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons
They separated are, and why less wroth
Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer
O Sun, that healest all distempered vision
Once more a little backward turn thee, said I
Goodness divine, and disengage the knot
Philosophy, he said, to him who heeds it
After what manner Nature takes her course
After not many pages shalt thou find
Follows, as the disciple doth the master
So that your art is, as it were, God's grandchild
Genesis at the beginning, it behoves
Mankind to gain their life and to advance
And since the usurer takes another way
Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope
For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon
And far beyond there we descend the crag
The place where to descend the bank we came
Of such a kind that every eye would shun it
Either by earthquake or by failing stay
For from the mountain's top, from which it moved
Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so
Some path 'twould give to him who was above
The infamy of Crete was stretched along
Who was conceived in the fictitious cow
My Sage towards him shouted: Peradventure
Thou think'st that here may be the Duke of Athens
Who in the world above brought death to thee?
Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not
Instructed by thy sister, but he comes
In order to behold your punishments
As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment
In which he has received the mortal blow
Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there
The Minotaur beheld I do the like
And he, the wary, cried: Run to the passage
While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend
Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge
Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves
Thoughtful I went; and he said: Thou art thinking
Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded
By that brute anger which just now I quenched
Now will I have thee know, the other time
This precipice had not yet fallen down
Before His coming who the mighty spoil
Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle
Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think
The world ofttimes converted into chaos
Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow
But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near
Whoe'er by violence doth injure others
That spurs us onward so in our short life
I saw an ample moat bent like a bow
Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows
As in the world they used the chase to follow
Beholding us descend, each one stood still
And from the squadron three detached themselves
With bows and arrows in advance selected
And from afar one cried: Unto what torment
Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?
Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow
My Master said: Our answer will we make
Then touched he me, and said: This one is Nessus
And for himself, himself did vengeance take
And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing
Thousands and thousands go about the moat
Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges
Near we approached unto those monsters fleet
Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch
Backward upon his jaws he put his beard
After he had uncovered his great mouth
He said to his companions: Are you ware
That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?
Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men
And my good Guide, who now was at his breast
Me it behoves to show him the dark valley
Necessity, and not delight, impels us
Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja
Who unto me committed this new office
But by that virtue through which I am moving
Give us some one of thine, to be with us
And who may show us where to pass the ford
And who may carry this one on his back
For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air
Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about
And said to Nessus: Turn and do thou guide them
And warn aside, if other band may meet you
We with our faithful escort onward moved
Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments
People I saw within up to the eyebrows
And the great Centaur said: Tyrants are these
Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging
Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here
Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years
That forehead there which has the hair so black
Up in the world was by his stepson slain
Now he be first to thee, and second I
Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth
A shade he showed us on one side alone
Saying: He cleft asunder in God's bosom
The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured
Then people saw I, who from out the river
Lifted their heads and also all the chest
That blood, so that the feet alone it covered
The boiling stream, that aye diminishes
Its bed, until it reunites itself
Where it behoveth tyranny to groan
Justice divine, upon this side, is goading
That Attila, who was a scourge on earth
Who made upon the highways so much war
Then back he turned, and passed again the ford
Not yet had Nessus reached the other side
When we had put ourselves within a wood
That was not marked by any path whatever
Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled
Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense
Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold
'Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places
There do the hideous Harpies make their nests
Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human
And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged
They make laments upon the wondrous trees
And the good Master: Ere thou enter farther
Know that thou art within the second round
Thus he began to say, and shalt be, till
Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see
Things that will credence give unto my speech
I heard on all sides lamentations uttered
And person none beheld I who might make them
So many voices issued through those trunks
From people who concealed themselves from us
Therefore the Master said: If thou break off
The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain
Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward
And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn
And the trunk cried, Why dost thou mangle me?
After it had become embrowned with blood
It recommenced its cry: Why dost thou rend me?
Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?
Men once we were, and now are changed to trees
Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful
Even if the souls of serpents we had been
And hisses with the wind that is escaping
So from that splinter issued forth together
Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip
Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid
My Sage made answer, O thou wounded soul
What only in my verses he has seen
Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand
Whereas the thing incredible has caused me
To put him to an act which grieveth me
But tell him who thou wast, so that by way
Of some amends thy fame he may refresh
Up in the world, to which he can return
And the trunk said: So thy sweet words allure me
That I a little to discourse am tempted
I am the one who both keys had in keeping
Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro
So softly in unlocking and in locking
That from his secrets most men I withheld
Fidelity I bore the glorious office
So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses
Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes
Inflamed against me all the other minds
That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings
Thinking by dying to escape disdain
Do swear to you that never broke I faith
Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour
And to the world if one of you return
Let him my memory comfort, which is lying
Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it
The Poet said to me, lose not the time
Whence I to him: Do thou again inquire
Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me
Therefore he recommenced: So may the man
Do for thee freely what thy speech implores
To tell us in what way the soul is bound
Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst
If any from such members e'er is freed
Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward
The wind was into such a voice converted:
With brevity shall be replied to you
The body whence it rent itself away
Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss
It falls into the forest, and no part
There like a grain of spelt it germinates
It springs a sapling, and a forest tree
The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves
Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet
Like others for our spoils shall we return
But not that any one may them revest
For 'tis not just to have what one casts off
Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal
Forest our bodies shall suspended be
Each to the thorn of his molested shade
When by a tumult we were overtaken
In the same way as he is who perceives
The boar and chase approaching to his stand
Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches
That of the forest, every fan they broke
He who was in advance: Now help, Death, help!
And the other one, who seemed to lag too much
And then, perchance because his breath was failing
He grouped himself together with a bush
As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain
On him who had crouched down they set their teeth
And him they lacerated piece by piece
Thereafter bore away those aching members
Thereat my Escort took me by the hand
And led me to the bush, that all in vain
Was weeping from its bloody lacerations
What helped it thee of me to make a screen?
What blame have I in thy nefarious life?
When near him had the Master stayed his steps
He said: Who wast thou, that through wounds so many
Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?
And he to us: O souls, that hither come
To look upon the shameful massacre
That has so rent away from me my leaves
Gather them up beneath the dismal bush
Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this
Forever with his art will make it sad
Some glimpses of him are remaining still
Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it
Upon the ashes left by Attila
In vain had caused their labour to be done
Of my own house I made myself a gibbet
Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves
Then came we to the confine, where disparted
Clearly to manifest these novel things
I say that we arrived upon a plain
Which from its bed rejecteth every plant
There close upon the edge we stayed our feet
Not of another fashion made than that
Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed
By each one to be dreaded, who doth read
And over them seemed set a law diverse
Supine upon the ground some folk were lying
And others went about continually
And those were less who lay down to their torment
But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation
Were raining down dilated flakes of fire
Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground
Whence he provided with his phalanxes
To trample down the soil, because the vapour
Thus was descending the eternal heat
Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder
Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole
Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds
All things except the demons dire, that issued
Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not
So that the rain seems not to ripen him?
If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom
He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt
Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten
And if he wearied out by turns the others
Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!
Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra
And shot his bolts at me with all his might
He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance
Then did my Leader speak with such great force
Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more
Not any torment, saving thine own rage
Would be unto thy fury pain complete
Then he turned round to me with better lip
Saying: One of the Seven Kings was he
God in disdain, and little seems to prize him
But, as I said to him, his own despites
Now follow me, and mind thou do not place
As yet thy feet upon the burning sand
But always keep them close unto the wood
Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes
Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end
The sinful women later share among them
So downward through the sand it went its way
The bottom of it, and both sloping banks
Were made of stone, and the margins at the side
Whence I perceived that there the passage was
In all the rest which I have shown to thee
Since we have entered in within the gate
Whose threshold unto no one is denied
Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes
Which all the little flames above it quenches
These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him
That he would give me largess of the food
For which he had given me largess of desire
In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land
Said he thereafterward, whose name is Crete
With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida
Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out
Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle
Of her own son; and to conceal him better
Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made
A grand old man stands in the mount erect
Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta
And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror
His head is fashioned of refined gold
From that point downward all is chosen iron
Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay
Which gathered together perforate that cavern
From rock to rock they fall into this valley
Then downward go along this narrow sluice
Unto that point where is no more descending
They form Cocytus; what that pool may be
Doth take its rise in this way from our world
Why only on this verge appears it to us?
And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far
Still to the left descending to the bottom
Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned
It should not bring amazement to thy face
And sayest the other of this rain is made?
In all thy questions truly thou dost please me
Replied he; but the boiling of the red
Water might well solve one of them thou makest
Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat
There where the souls repair to lave themselves
When sin repented of has been removed
Then said he: It is time now to abandon
The wood; take heed that thou come after me
A way the margins make that are not burning
And over them all vapours are extinguished
Now bears us onward one of the hard margins
From fire it saves the water and the dikes
Even as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges
Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself
Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight
To guard their villas and their villages
Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat
In such similitude had those been made
Whoever he might be, the master made them
When we a company of souls encountered
Who came beside the dike, and every one
Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont
To eye each other under a new moon
And so towards us sharpened they their brows
Thus scrutinised by such a family
By some one I was recognised, who seized
My garment's hem, and cried out, What a marvel!
And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me
On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes
That the scorched countenance prevented not
And bowing down my face unto his own
I made reply, Are you here, Ser Brunetto?
And he: May't not displease thee, O my son
Backward return and let the trail go on
I said to him: With all my power I ask it
O son, he said, whoever of this herd
A moment stops, lies then a hundred years
Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire
Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come
And afterward will I rejoin my band
Which goes lamenting its eternal doom
I did not dare to go down from the road
Level to walk with him; but my head bowed
And he began: What fortune or what fate
And who is this that showeth thee the way?
I answered him, I lost me in a valley
Or ever yet my age had been completed
But yestermorn I turned my back upon it
This one appeared to me, returning thither
And homeward leadeth me along this road
And he to me: If thou thy star do follow
Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port
If well I judged in the life beautiful
I would have given thee comfort in the work
Which of old time from Fesole descended
Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe
And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs
It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit
Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind
Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee
One party and the other shall be hungry
For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass
Their litter let the beasts of Fesole
Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant
Seed of those Romans, who remained there when
The nest of such great malice it became
If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled
In banishment from human nature placed
For in my mind is fixed, and touches now
You taught me how a man becomes eternal
Behoves that in my language be discerned
What you narrate of my career I write
And keep it to be glossed with other text
Provided that my conscience do not chide me
Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around
As it may please her, and the churl his mattock
Nor speaking less on that account, I go
His most known and most eminent companions
Of others it were laudable to be silent
For short would be the time for so much speech
Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks
In the world tainted with the selfsame sin
Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd
And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there
If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf
Where he has left his sin-excited nerves
A people comes with whom I may not be
Across the plain; and seemed to be among them
The one who wins, and not the one who loses
Now was I where was heard the reverberation
Of water falling into the next round
Like to that humming which the beehives make
When shadows three together started forth
Running, from out a company that passed
Towards us came they, and each one cried out:
Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest
To be some one of our depraved city
Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs
Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!
Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive
He turned his face towards me, and Now wait
And if it were not for the fire that darts
The nature of this region, I should say
That haste were more becoming thee than them
The old refrain, and when they overtook us
Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them
As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do
Watching for their advantage and their hold
Before they come to blows and thrusts between them
Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage
His neck and feet continual journey made
Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties
Began one, and our aspect black and blistered
Let the renown of us thy mind incline
To tell us who thou art, who thus securely
Thy living feet dost move along through Hell
He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading
Naked and skinless though he now may go
Was of a greater rank than thou dost think
Much did he with his wisdom and his sword
The other, who close by me treads the sand
Above there in the world should welcome be
And I, who with them on the cross am placed
My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me
Could I have been protected from the fire
And think the Teacher would have suffered it
My terror overmastered my good will
Then I began: Sorrow and not disdain
Did your condition fix within me so
Words, on account of which I thought within me
That people such as you are were approaching
I of your city am; and evermore
I with affection have retraced and heard
I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits
Promised to me by the veracious Leader
But to the centre first I needs must plunge
Those limbs of thine, did he make answer then
Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell
Within our city, as they used to do
For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment
With us of late, and goes there with his comrades
Doth greatly mortify us with his words
Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered
In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted
And the three, taking that for my reply
Looked at each other, as one looks at truth
If other times so little it doth cost thee
Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!
Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places
And come to rebehold the beauteous stars
See that thou speak of us unto the people
Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight
It seemed as if their agile legs were wings
Not an Amen could possibly be said
Even as that stream which holdeth its own course
Which is above called Acquacheta, ere
From Alps, by falling at a single leap
We found resounding that dark-tinted water
So that it soon the ear would have offended
I had a cord around about me girt
And therewithal I whilom had designed
To take the panther with the painted skin
Whereat he turned himself to the right side
He cast it down into that deep abyss
It must needs be some novelty respond
I said within myself, to the new signal
The Master with his eye is following so
Ah me! how very cautious men should be
With those who not alone behold the act
But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!
What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming
Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight
Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood
A man should close his lips as far as may be
Because without his fault it causes shame
Of this my Comedy to thee I swear
So may they not be void of lasting favour
Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere
I saw a figure swimming upward come
Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled
Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden
Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet
Behold the monster with the pointed tail
Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons
Behold him who infecteth all the world
And beckoned him that he should come to shore
Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust
But on the border did not drag its tail
Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits
The back, and breast, and both the sides it had
Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields
Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks
Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid
As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore
The beaver plants himself to wage his war
So that vile monster lay upon the border
His tail was wholly quivering in the void
Contorting upwards the envenomed fork
That in the guise of scorpion armed its point
The Guide said: Now perforce must turn aside
Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him
We therefore on the right side descended
And made ten steps upon the outer verge
Completely to avoid the sand and flame
A people sitting near the hollow place
Experience of this round thou bear away
Now go and see what their condition is
There let thy conversation be concise
Till thou returnest I will speak with him
That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders
I went, where sat the melancholy folk
Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe
This way, that way, they helped them with their hands
Not otherwise in summer do the dogs
By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten
When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces
Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling
That from the neck of each there hung a pouch
Which certain colour had, and certain blazon
And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding
Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw
That had the face and posture of a lion
Proceeding then the current of my sight
Another of them saw I, red as blood
Display a goose more white than butter is
Emblazoned had his little pouch of white
Said unto me: What dost thou in this moat?
Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive
Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano
Will have his seat here on my left-hand side
Full many a time they thunder in mine ears
Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier
He who shall bring the satchel with three goats
Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust
His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose
Backward I turned me from those weary souls
Now we descend by stairways such as these
Mount thou in front, for I will be midway
So that the tail may have no power to harm thee
Such as he is who has so near the ague
And trembles all, but looking at the shade
Even such became I at those proffered words
But shame in me his menaces produced
I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders
I wished to say, and yet the voice came not
As I believed, Take heed that thou embrace me
But he, who other times had rescued me
In other peril, soon as I had mounted
Within his arms encircled and sustained me
The circles large, and the descent be little
Think of the novel burden which thou hast
Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew
There where his breast had been he turned his tail
And that extended like an eel he moved
And with his paws drew to himself the air
A greater fear I do not think there was
What time abandoned Phaeton the reins
Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax
His father crying, An ill way thou takest!
On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished
Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only
I heard already on the right the whirlpool
Making a horrible crashing under us
Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward
Because I fires beheld, and heard laments
Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling
The turning and descending, by great horrors
That were approaching upon divers sides
As falcon who has long been on the wing
Who, without seeing either lure or bird
Maketh the falconer say, Ah me, thou stoopest
Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom
And being disencumbered of our persons
He sped away as arrow from the string
There is a place in Hell called Malebolge
As is the circle that around it turns
Of which its place the structure will recount
Round, then, is that enclosure which remains
Many and many moats surround the castles
The part in which they are a figure forms
Just such an image those presented there
Project, which intersected dikes and moats
Unto the well that truncates and collects them
Within this place, down shaken from the back
Held to the left, and I moved on behind
Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish
This side the middle came they facing us
Have chosen a mode to pass the people over
Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's
On the other side they go towards the Mountain
Beheld I horned demons with great scourges
Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs
At the first blows! and sooth not any one
While I was going on, mine eyes by one
With sight of this one I am not unfed
Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out
And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand
Lowering his face, but little it availed him
For said I: Thou that castest down thine eyes
But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?
But forces me thine utterance distinct
Which makes me recollect the ancient world
Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis
Howe'er the shameless story may be told
That not so many tongues to-day are taught
'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa
Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart
While speaking in this manner, with his scourge
A demon smote him, and said: Get thee gone
I joined myself again unto mine Escort
Thereafterward with footsteps few we came
To where a crag projected from the bank
And turning to the right along its ridge
From those eternal circles we departed
Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged
The Guide said: Wait, and see that on thee strike
The vision of those others evil-born
Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces
From the old bridge we looked upon the train
Which tow'rds us came upon the other border
Said to me: See that tall one who is coming
And for his pain seems not to shed a tear
Still what a royal aspect he retains!
The Colchians of the Ram made destitute
He by the isle of Lemnos passed along
After the daring women pitiless
Had unto death devoted all their males
Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden
Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived
Such sin unto such punishment condemns him
And also for Medea is vengeance done
With him go those who in such wise deceive
To know, and those that in its jaws it holds
Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms
Thence we heard people, who are making moan
In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles
And with their palms beating upon themselves
The margins were incrusted with a mould
By exhalation from below, that sticks there
And with the eyes and nostrils wages war
The bottom is so deep, no place suffices
To give us sight of it, without ascending
Thither we came, and thence down in the moat
I saw a people smothered in a filth
That out of human privies seemed to flow
And whilst below there with mine eye I search
I saw one with his head so foul with ordure
It was not clear if he were clerk or layman
He screamed to me: Wherefore art thou so eager
To look at me more than the other foul ones?
I have already seen thee with dry hair
Therefore I eye thee more than all the others
And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:
The flatteries have submerged me here below
Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited
That with thine eyes thou well the face attain
Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab
Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails
And crouches now, and now on foot is standing
Thais the harlot is it, who replied
Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I
And herewith let our sight be satisfied
Ye who the things of God, which ought to be
Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound
We had already on the following tomb
Ascended to that portion of the crag
Which o'er the middle of the moat hangs plumb
And with what justice doth thy power distribute!
I saw upon the sides and on the bottom
The livid stone with perforations filled
Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers
I broke for some one, who was drowning in it
Be this a seal all men to undeceive
Out of the mouth of each one there protruded
Up to the calf, the rest within remained
Wherefore the joints so violently quivered
They would have snapped asunder withes and bands
To move upon the outer surface only
So likewise was it there from heel to point
More than his other comrades quivering
I said, and whom a redder flame is sucking?
And he to me: If thou wilt have me bear thee
Down there along that bank which lowest lies
From him thou'lt know his errors and himself
Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not
From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken
Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived
We turned, and on the left-hand side descended
Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me
Of him who so lamented with his shanks
Whoe'er thou art, that standest upside down
O doleful soul, implanted like a stake
To say began I, if thou canst, speak out
I stood even as the friar who is confessing
The false assassin, who, when he is fixed
Recalls him, so that death may be delayed
And he cried out: Dost thou stand there already
Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?
By many years the record lied to me
For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud
The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?
Such I became, as people are who stand
Then said Virgilius: Say to him straightway
Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet
Said to me: Then what wantest thou of me?
That thou on that account hast crossed the bank
Know that I vested was with the great mantle
So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth
Beneath my head the others are dragged down
Who have preceded me in simony
Flattened along the fissure of the rock
That one shall come who I believed thou wast
What time the sudden question I proposed
And here have been in this way upside down
Than he will planted stay with reddened feet
For after him shall come of fouler deed
Such as befits to cover him and me
So he who governs France shall be to this one
That him I answered only in this metre:
I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure
Before he put the keys into his keeping?
Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias
Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen
Unto the place the guilty soul had lost
Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished
And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money
I would make use of words more grievous still
Because your avarice afflicts the world
Trampling the good and lifting the depraved
The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind
When she who sitteth upon many waters
To fornicate with kings by him was seen
The same who with the seven heads was born
And power and strength from the ten horns received
So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing
Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver
And from the idolater how differ ye
Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?
Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother
And while I sang to him such notes as these
Either that anger or that conscience stung him
He struggled violently with both his feet
I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased
With such contented lip he listened ever
Unto the sound of the true words expressed
Therefore with both his arms he took me up
And when he had me all upon his breast
Remounted by the way where he descended
But bore me to the summit of the arch
There tenderly he laid his burden down
That would have been hard passage for the goats:
Thence was unveiled to me another valley
Of a new pain behoves me to make verses
And give material to the twentieth canto
Of the first song, which is of the submerged
To peer down into the uncovered depth
Which bathed itself with tears of agony
And people saw I through the circular valley
Silent and weeping, coming at the pace
Which in this world the Litanies assume
As lower down my sight descended on them
Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted
For tow'rds the reins the countenance was turned
Some one has been thus wholly turned awry
But I ne'er saw it, nor believe it can be
As God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit
From this thy reading, think now for thyself
How I could ever keep my face unmoistened
When our own image near me I beheld
Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes
Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts
Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak
Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said
Here pity lives when it is wholly dead
Who feels compassion at the doom divine?
Lift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom
Opened the earth before the Thebans' eyes
Wherefore they all cried: 'Whither rushest thou
Amphiaraus?Why dost leave the war?
As far as Minos, who lays hold on all
See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!
Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:
Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed
When from a male a female he became
His members being all of them transformed
Ere he could have again his manly plumes
That Aruns is, who backs the other's belly
Among the marbles white a cavern had
For his abode; whence to behold the stars
And sea, the view was not cut off from him
And she there, who is covering up her breasts
And on that side has all the hairy skin
Was Manto, who made quest through many lands
After her father had from life departed
And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved
She a long season wandered through the world
Above in beauteous Italy lies a lake
Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco
By a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed
With water that grows stagnant in that lake
Might give his blessing, if he passed that way
There of necessity must fall whatever
In bosom of Benaco cannot stay
And grows a river down through verdant pastures
Soon as the water doth begin to run
And oft 'tis wont in summer to be sickly
Passing that way the virgin pitiless
Land in the middle of the fen descried
There to escape all human intercourse
She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise
And lived, and left her empty body there
The men, thereafter, who were scattered round
Collected in that place, which was made strong
By the lagoon it had on every side
They built their city over those dead bones
And, after her who first the place selected
Mantua named it, without other omen
From Pinamonte had received deceit
Therefore I caution thee, if e'er thou hearest
Originate my city otherwise
No falsehood may the verity defraud
To me so certain, and so take my faith
That unto me the rest would be spent coals
But tell me of the people who are passing
For only unto that my mind reverts
Then said he to me: He who from the cheek
Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders
Was, at the time when Greece was void of males
So that there scarce remained one in the cradle
An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment
In Aulis, when to sever the first cable
Eryphylus his name was, and so sings
That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it
The next, who is so slender in the flanks
Of magical illusions knew the game
Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents
Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle
The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers
They wrought their magic spells with herb and image
But come now, for already holds the confines
Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns
Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee
Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while
From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things
We came along, and held the summit, when
We halted to behold another fissure
To smear their unsound vessels o'er again
One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks
The ribs of that which many a voyage has made
This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists
Was boiling down below there a dense pitch
Which upon every side the bank belimed
Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised
And all swell up and resubside compressed
The while below there fixedly I gazed
My Leader, crying out: Beware, beware!
Who, while he looks, delays not his departure
And I beheld behind us a black devil
Running along upon the crag, approach
And how he seemed to me in action ruthless
His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high
A sinner did encumber with both haunches
And he held clutched the sinews of the feet
From off our bridge, he said: O Malebranche
Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita
Plunge him beneath, for I return for others
Unto that town, which is well furnished with them
No into Yes for money there is changed
He hurled him down, and over the hard crag
Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened
In so much hurry to pursue a thief
Cried: Here the Santo Volto has no place!
Do not uplift thyself above the pitch
They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes
They said: It here behoves thee to dance covered
Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make
The meat with hooks, so that it may not float
Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen
And for no outrage that is done to me
Be thou afraid, because these things I know
Then he passed on beyond the bridge's head
And as upon the sixth bank he arrived
Need was for him to have a steadfast front
As dogs leap out upon a mendicant
Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops
They issued from beneath the little bridge
And turned against him all their grappling-irons
But he cried out: Be none of you malignant!
Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me
And then take counsel as to grappling me
Whereat one started, and the rest stood still
Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me
Advanced into this place, my Master said
That I another show this savage road
Then was his arrogance so humbled in him
That he let fall his grapnel at his feet
And to the others said: Now strike him not
And unto me my Guide: O thou, who sittest
Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down
And all the devils forward thrust themselves
So that I feared they would not keep their compact
Who issued under safeguard from Caprona
Seeing themselves among so many foes
Close did I press myself with all my person
Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes
From off their countenance, which was not good
They lowered their rakes, and Wilt thou have me hit him
They said to one another, on the rump?
And answered: Yes; see that thou nick him with it
But the same demon who was holding parley
Forward upon this crag, because is lying
All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch
Pursue your way along upon this rock
Near is another crag that yields a path
Years were complete, that here the way was broken
I send in that direction some of mine
To see if any one doth air himself
Began he to cry out, and thou, Cagnazzo
Let these be safe as far as the next crag
That all unbroken passes o'er the dens
Pray let us go, I said, without an escort
If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none
Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth
And with their brows are threatening woe to us?
And he to me: I will not have thee fear
Let them gnash on, according to their fancy
Because they do it for those boiling wretches
Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about
But first had each one thrust his tongue between
And he had made a trumpet of his rump
I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp
Begin the storming, and their muster make
And sometimes starting off for their escape
Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land
O Aretines, and foragers go forth
Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run
But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth
Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry
We went upon our way with the ten demons
To see the whole condition of that Bolgia
And of the people who therein were burned
Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign
To mariners by arching of the back
That they should counsel take to save their vessel
Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain
One of the sinners would display his back
And in less time conceal it than it lightens
The frogs stand only with their muzzles out
So that they hide their feet and other bulk
So upon every side the sinners stood
Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew
I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it
One frog remains, and down another dives
Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch
And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter
I knew, before, the names of all of them
O Rubicante, see that thou do lay
Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him
Cried all together the accursed ones
And I: My Master, see to it, if thou canst
That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight
Thus come into his adversaries' hands
Near to the side of him my Leader drew
I in the kingdom of Navarre was born
My mother placed me servant to a lord
For she had borne me to a ribald knave
I set me there to practise barratry
For which I pay the reckoning in this heat
And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected
Among malicious cats the mouse had come
But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms
And said: Stand ye aside, while I enfork him
And to my Master he turned round his head
Ask him again, he said, if more thou wish
To know from him, before some one destroy him
The Guide: Now tell then of the other culprits
Knowest thou any one who is a Latian
Lately from one who was a neighbour to it
For I should fear not either claw nor hook!
And with his grapnel seized him by the arm
So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon
Turned round and round about with evil look
Of him, who still was looking at his wound
Demanded my Conductor without stay:
Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?
Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand
And dealt so with them each exults thereat
Money he took, and let them smoothly off
As he says; and in other offices
A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign
To gossip never do their tongues feel tired
O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth
Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready
Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike
Said: Stand aside there, thou malicious bird
The terror-stricken recommenced thereon
So that these may not their revenges fear
And I, down sitting in this very place
When I shall whistle, as our custom is
Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted
Shaking his head, and said: Just hear the trick
Whence he, who snares in great abundance had
Responded: I by far too cunning am
When I procure for mine a greater sadness
Unto the rest, said to him: If thou dive
I will not follow thee upon the gallop
But I will beat my wings above the pitch
The height be left, and be the bank a shield
O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!
Each to the other side his eyes averted
The Navarrese selected well his time
Planted his feet on land, and in a moment
Leaped, and released himself from their design
Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame
But he most who was cause of the defeat
Therefore he moved, and cried: Thou art o'ertakern
But little it availed, for wings could not
Outstrip the fear; the other one went under
And, flying, upward he his breast directed
Dives under, when the falcon is approaching
And upward he returneth cross and weary
The other should escape, to have a quarrel
And when the barrator had disappeared
He turned his talons upon his companion
And grappled with him right above the moat
But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk
Fell in the middle of the boiling pond
But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught
To such degree they had their wings belimed
Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia
Made four of them fly to the other side
This side and that they to their posts descended
They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared
Who were already baked within the crust
And in this manner busied did we leave them
We went, the one in front, the other after
As go the Minor Friars along their way
Upon the fable of Aesop was directed
Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse
Than this one is to that, if well we couple
End and beginning with a steadfast mind
And even as one thought from another springs
Which the first fear within me double made
Thus did I ponder: These on our account
Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff
If anger be engrafted on ill-will
They will come after us more merciless
Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes
I felt my hair stand all on end already
With terror, and stood backwardly intent
I am in dread; we have them now behind us
And he: If I were made of leaded glass
Thine outward image I should not attract
Sooner to me than I imprint the inner
Just now thy thoughts came in among my own
So that of both one counsel sole I made
We shall escape from the imagined chase
Not yet he finished rendering such opinion
When I beheld them come with outstretched wings
My Leader on a sudden seized me up
Even as a mother who by noise is wakened
And close beside her sees the enkindled flames
Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop
Having more care of him than of herself
So that she clothes her only with a shift
Supine he gave him to the pendent rock
Ne'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice
To turn the wheel of any land-built mill
When nearest to the paddles it approaches
As did my Master down along that border
Bearing me with him on his breast away
His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill
To place them ministers of the fifth moat
The power of thence departing took from all
A painted people there below we found
Who went about with footsteps very slow
Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished
They had on mantles with the hoods low down
Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut
That in Cologne they for the monks are made
That Frederick used to put them on of straw
O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!
Again we turned us, still to the left hand
But owing to the weight, that weary folk
Whence I unto my Leader: See thou find
Some one who may by deed or name be known
And thus in going move thine eye about
And one, who understood the Tuscan speech
Cried to us from behind: Stay ye your feet
Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!
And then according to his pace proceed
I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste
Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me
But the burden and the narrow way delayed them
When they came up, long with an eye askance
They scanned me without uttering a word
He by the action of his throat seems living
Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?
Then said to me: Tuscan, who to the college
Of miserable hypocrites art come
Do not disdain to tell us who thou art
And with the body am I've always had
Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?
And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?
And one replied to me: These orange cloaks
Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights
Cause in this way their balances to creak
Named, and together taken by thy city
As the wont is to take one man alone
O Friars, began I, your iniquitous. . 
But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed
One crucified with three stakes on the ground
Blowing into his beard with suspirations
To put one man to torture for the people
As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel
And in like mode his father-in-law is punished
O'er him who was extended on the cross
Then he directed to the Friar this voice:
Without constraining some of the black angels
To come and extricate us from this deep
Then he made answer: Nearer than thou hopest
Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys
You will be able to mount up the ruin
The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down
Then said: The business badly he recounted
Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder
Thereat my Leader with great strides went on
Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks
And now the nights draw near to half the day
But little lasts the temper of her pen
Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign
All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank
Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do
Then he returns and hope revives again
Seeing the world has changed its countenance
In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook
And forth the little lambs to pasture drives
Thus did the Master fill me with alarm
When I beheld his forehead so disturbed
And to the ailment came as soon the plaster
For as we came unto the ruined bridge
The Leader turned to me with that sweet look
His arms he opened, after some advisement
Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me
And even as he who acts and meditates
So upward lifting me towards the summit
Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag
Saying: To that one grapple afterwards
This was no way for one clothed with a cloak
Were able to ascend from jag to jag
And had it not been, that upon that precinct
But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth
Of the profoundest well is all inclining
That one bank rises and the other sinks
Still we arrived at length upon the point
Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder
The breath was from my lungs so milked away
Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival
Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth
Withouten which whoso his life consumes
And therefore raise thee up, o'ercome the anguish
If with its heavy body it sink not
A longer stairway it behoves thee mount
Let it avail thee, if thou understand me
Better with breath than I did feel myself
Upward we took our way along the crag
Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth
Not well adapted to articulate words
I know not what it said, though o'er the back
I now was of the arch that passes there
But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking
I was bent downward, but my living eyes
Could not attain the bottom, for the dark
Wherefore I: Master, see that thou arrive
At the next round, and let us descend the wall
Other response, he said, I make thee not
Ought to be followed by the deed in silence
We from the bridge descended at its head
Where it connects itself with the eighth bank
That the remembrance still congeals my blood
Let Libya boast no longer with her sand
E'er showed she with all Ethiopia
People were running naked and affrighted
They had their hands with serpents bound behind them
These riveted upon their reins the tail
And head, and were in front of them entwined
And lo! at one who was upon our side
There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him
There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders
Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written
As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly
And when he on the ground was thus destroyed
The ashes drew together, and of themselves
Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed
The phoenix dies, and then is born again
When it approaches its five-hundredth year
On herb or grain it feeds not in its life
By force of demons who to earth down drag him
Or other oppilation that binds man
Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish
Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs
Such was that sinner after he had risen
That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!
A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me
Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci
And ask what crime has thrust him here below
For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him
And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not
But unto me directed mind and face
And with a melancholy shame was painted
Then said: It pains me more that thou hast caught me
Amid this misery where thou seest me
Than when I from the other life was taken
What thou demandest I cannot deny
If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places
Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:
Then Florence doth renew her men and manners
Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra
Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round
Over Campo Picen shall be the battle
When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder
And this I've said that it may give thee pain
Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs
For one entwined itself about his neck
And round his arms another, and rebound him
Clinching itself together so in front
That with them he could not a motion make
Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not
To burn thyself to ashes and so perish
Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?
Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!
He fled away, and spake no further word
And I beheld a Centaur full of rage
Come crying out: Where is, where is the scoffer?
Serpents as he had all along his back
As far as where our countenance begins
With wings wide open was a dragon lying
And he sets fire to all that he encounters
My Master said: That one is Cacus, who
Created oftentimes a lake of blood
He goes not on the same road with his brothers
By reason of the fraudulent theft he made
Of the great herd, which he had near to him
Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath
The mace of Hercules, who peradventure
And spirits three had underneath us come
Until what time they shouted: Who are you?
On which account our story made a halt
As it is wont to happen by some chance
That one to name the other was compelled
Upward from chin to nose my finger laid
If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe
What I shall say, it will no marvel be
As I was holding raised on them my brows
Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth
With middle feet it bound him round the paunch
And with the forward ones his arms it seized
Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other
The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs
And put its tail through in between the two
And up behind along the reins outspread it
Ivy was never fastened by its barbs
Upon the other's limbs entwined its own
Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax
They had been made, and intermixed their colour
Cried out: O me, Agnello, how thou changest!
Behold, thou now art neither two nor one
Already the two heads had one become
When there appeared to us two figures mingled
Into one face, wherein the two were lost
Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms
Members became that never yet were seen
Every original aspect there was cancelled
Two and yet none did the perverted image
Appear, and such departed with slow pace
Of days canicular, exchanging hedge
Lightning appeareth if the road it cross
Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies
And in that part whereat is first received
Our aliment, it one of them transfixed
Then downward fell in front of him extended
The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught
Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned
Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him
He at the serpent gazed, and it at him
Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled
For if him to a snake, her to fountain
Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not
Has he transmuted, so that both the forms
To interchange their matter ready were
That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail
And eke the wounded drew his feet together
Adhered so, that in little time the juncture
No sign whatever made that was apparent
He with the cloven tail assumed the figure
The other one was losing, and his skin
I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits
Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted
Became the member that a man conceals
And of his own the wretch had two created
Though turning not away their impious lamps
Underneath which each one his muzzle changed
He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples
And from excess of matter, which came thither
Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks
Of that excess made to the face a nose
And the lips thickened far as was befitting
He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward
And backward draws the ears into his head
And so the tongue, which was entire and apt
For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked
In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases
The soul, which to a reptile had been changed
Along the valley hissing takes to flight
And after him the other speaking sputters
Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders
Crawling as I have done, along this road
In this way I beheld the seventh ballast
Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse
The novelty, if aught my pen transgress
And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be
Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed
Which came in the beginning, was not changed
Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great
And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!
Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me
But if when morn is near our dreams are true
Feel shalt thou in a little time from now
For 'twill aggrieve me more the more I age
We went our way, and up along the stairs
The bourns had made us to descend before
And following the solitary path
The foot without the hand sped not at all
Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again
When I direct my mind to what I saw
And more my genius curb than I am wont
That it may run not unless virtue guide it
Rests at the time when he who lights the world
His countenance keeps least concealed from us
While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)
Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage
As soon as I was where the depth appeared
And such as he who with the bears avenged him
Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing
What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose
For with his eye he could not follow it
So as to see aught else than flame alone
Even as a little cloud ascending upward
Was moving; for not one reveals the theft
And every flame a sinner steals away
I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see
So that, if I had seized not on a rock
And the Leader, who beheld me so attent
Exclaimed: Within the fires the spirits are
Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns
Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft
At top, it seems uprising from the pyre
Where was Eteocles with his brother placed
They unto vengeance run as unto wrath
And there within their flame do they lament
The ambush of the horse, which made the door
Whence issued forth the Romans' gentle seed
Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead
Deidamia still deplores Achilles
And pain for the Palladium there is borne
If they within those sparks possess the power
And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand
That thou make no denial of awaiting
Until the horned flame shall hither come
Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it
Of much applause, and therefore I accept it
But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself
That which thou wishest; for they might disdain
Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine
When now the flame had come unto that point
Where to my Leader it seemed time and place
After this fashion did I hear him speak:
O ye, who are twofold within one fire
When in the world I wrote the lofty verses
Murmuring, began to wave itself about
Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues
Moving as if it were the tongue that spake
It uttered forth a voice, and said: When I
Could overcome within me the desire
I had to be experienced of the world
But I put forth on the high open sea
Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain
When at that narrow passage we arrived
Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals
That man no farther onward should adventure
On the right hand behind me left I Seville
Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West
Which is remaining of your senses still
Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge
Following the sun, of the unpeopled world
Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang
Ye were not made to live like unto brutes
So eager did I render my companions
And having turned our stern unto the morning
We of the oars made wings for our mad flight
Evermore gaining on the larboard side
It did not rise above the ocean floor
Five times rekindled and as many quenched
Had been the splendour underneath the moon
Since we had entered into the deep pass
When there appeared to us a mountain, dim
From distance, and it seemed to me so high
Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping
For out of the new land a whirlwind rose
And smote upon the fore part of the ship
Three times it made her whirl with all the waters
At the fourth time it made the stern uplift
Until the sea above us closed again
Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top
By a confused sound that issued from it
As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first
With the lament of him, and that was right
Who with his file had modulated it)
Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted
That, notwithstanding it was made of brass
Still it appeared with agony transfixed
Thus, by not having any way or issue
Converted were the melancholy words
But afterwards, when they had gathered way
Up through the point, giving it that vibration
The tongue had given them in their passage out
We heard it said: O thou, at whom I aim
My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard
Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee
Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning
Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land
Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression
Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war
When my Conductor touched me on the side
Saying: Speak thou: this one a Latian is
And I, who had beforehand my reply
In readiness, forthwith began to speak:
O soul, that down below there art concealed
Romagna thine is not and never has been
But open war I none have left there now
Ravenna stands as it long years has stood
So that she covers Cervia with her vans
The city which once made the long resistance
Who made such bad disposal of Montagna
Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth
Governs the Lioncel of the white lair
Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter
And that of which the Savio bathes the flank
Even as it lies between the plain and mountain
Lives between tyranny and a free state
Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art
Be not more stubborn than the rest have been
So may thy name hold front there in the world
After the fire a little more had roared
In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved
This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:
If I believed that my reply were made
To one who to the world would e'er return
This flame without more flickering would stand still
Did any one return, if I hear true
Without the fear of infamy I answer
Believing thus begirt to make amends
And truly my belief had been fulfilled
Who put me back into my former sins
And how and wherefore I will have thee hear
My mother gave to me, the deeds I did
I knew them all, and practised so their craft
That to the ends of earth the sound went forth
I saw myself arrived, when each one ought
To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes
Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me
Having a war near unto Lateran
And none of them had been to conquer Acre
Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land
In him regarded, nor in me that cord
Which used to make those girt with it more meagre
To cure his leprosy, within Soracte
So this one sought me out as an adept
To cure him of the fever of his pride
Because his words appeared inebriate
And then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid
Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me
How to raze Palestrina to the ground
Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock
As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two
The which my predecessor held not dear
Then urged me on his weighty arguments
There, where my silence was the worst advice
Of that sin into which I now must fall
Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat
Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong
He must come down among my servitors
Because he gave the fraudulent advice
From which time forth I have been at his hair
Because of the contradiction which consents not
When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure
Thou didst not think that I was a logician!
And after he had bitten it in great rage
Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this
When it had thus completed its recital
The flame departed uttering lamentations
Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn
Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee
By those who, sowing discord, win their burden
Who ever could, e'en with untrammelled words
Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full
Which now I saw, by many times narrating?
That have small room to comprehend so much
If were again assembled all the people
Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood
Shed by the Romans and the lingering war
That of the rings made such illustrious spoils
With those who felt the agony of blows
By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard
And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still
Where without arms the old Alardo conquered
And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off
A cask by losing centre-piece or cant
Between his legs were hanging down his entrails
That maketh excrement of what is eaten
He looked at me, and opened with his hands
His bosom, saying: See now how I rend me
In front of me doth Ali weeping go
While living were, and therefore are cleft thus
A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us
Putting again each one of all this ream
When we have gone around the doleful road
By reason that our wounds are closed again
Ere any one in front of him repass
But who art thou, that musest on the crag
Perchance to postpone going to the pain
That is adjudged upon thine accusations?
Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him
My Master made reply, to be tormented
But to procure him full experience
Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him
Who in the moat stood still to look at me
Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun
May give the victory to the Novarese
After one foot to go away he lifted
This word did Mahomet say unto me
Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it
Another one, who had his throat pierced through
And nose cut off close underneath the brows
And had no longer but a single ear
Staying to look in wonder with the others
Before the others did his gullet open
And said: O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn
And whom I once saw up in Latian land
If e'er thou see again the lovely plain
Cast over from their vessel shall they be
By the betrayal of a tyrant fell
That traitor, who sees only with one eye
And holds the land, which some one here with me
Would fain be fasting from the vision of
Will make them come unto a parley with him
Then will do so, that to Focara's wind
They will not stand in need of vow or prayer
If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee
Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw
Oped, crying: This is he, and he speaks not
This one, being banished, every doubt submerged
Always with detriment allowed delay
And one, who both his hands dissevered had
The stumps uplifting through the murky air
So that the blood made horrible his face
Cried out: Thou shalt remember Mosca also
Who said, alas! 'A thing done has an end!
And death unto thy race, thereto I added
Whence he, accumulating woe on woe
Departed, like a person sad and crazed
But I remained to look upon the crowd
And saw a thing which I should be afraid
If it were not that conscience reassures me
That good companion which emboldens man
A trunk without a head walk in like manner
As walked the others of the mournful herd
And by the hair it held the head dissevered
It of itself made to itself a lamp
When it was come close to the bridge's foot
It lifted high its arm with all the head
To bring more closely unto us its words
Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding
And so that thou may carry news of me
Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort
I made the father and the son rebellious
And David did with his accursed goadings
Because I parted persons so united
Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!
From its beginning, which is in this trunk
Thus is observed in me the counterpoise
These eyes of mine had so inebriated
But said Virgilius: What dost thou still gaze at?
Why is thy sight still riveted down there
Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge
Henceforth the time allotted us is brief
If thou hadst, I made answer thereupon
Attended to the cause for which I looked
I went, already making my reply
And superadding: In that cavern where
I held mine eyes with such attention fixed
I think a spirit of my blood laments
The sin which down below there costs so much
Thy thought from this time forward upon him
For him I saw below the little bridge
Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger
So wholly at that time wast thou impeded
Thou didst not look that way; so he departed
By any who is sharer in the shame
Thus did we speak as far as the first place
Upon the crag, which the next valley shows
Down to the bottom, if there were more light
Could manifest themselves unto our sight
Divers lamentings pierced me through and through
Which with compassion had their arrows barbed
Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands
What pain would be, if from the hospitals
All the diseases in one moat were gathered
Such was it here, and such a stench came from it
As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue
We had descended on the furthest bank
Punishes forgers, which she here records
I do not think a sadder sight to see
All fell, and afterwards the ancient people
According as the poets have affirmed
Were from the seed of ants restored again,)
Than was it to behold through that dark valley
The spirits languishing in divers heaps
One of the other lay, and others crawling
Shifted themselves along the dismal road
We step by step went onward without speech
Gazing upon and listening to the sick
Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies
I saw two sitting leaned against each other
From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs
And never saw I plied a currycomb
As every one was plying fast the bite
Of itching which no other succour had
And the nails downward with them dragged the scab
Or any other fish that has them largest
O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee
Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee
Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest
Both of us here, one weeping made reply
But who art thou, that questionest about us?
Down with this living man from cliff to cliff
Then broken was their mutual support
And trembling each one turned himself to me
With others who had heard him by rebound
So may your memory not steal away
But so may it survive 'neath many suns
Say to me who ye are, and of what people
Let not your foul and loathsome punishment
Make you afraid to show yourselves to me
I of Arezzo was, one made reply
'Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest
That I could rise by flight into the air
And he who had conceit, but little wit
Would have me show to him the art; and only
Be burned by one who held him as his son
For alchemy, which in the world I practised
So vain a people as the Sienese?
Whereat the other leper, who had heard me
Replied unto my speech: Taking out Stricca
Who knew the art of moderate expenses
Of cloves discovered earliest of all
Within that garden where such seed takes root
And taking out the band, among whom squandered
And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!
But, that thou know who thus doth second thee
Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye
Tow'rds me, so that my face well answer thee
And thou shalt see I am Capocchio's shade
Who metals falsified by alchemy
'Twas at the time when Juno was enraged
So reft of reason Athamas became
That, seeing his own wife with children twain
Walking encumbered upon either hand
He cried: Spread out the nets, that I may take
And then extended his unpitying claws
Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus
And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock
And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;--
And at the time when fortune downward hurled
The Trojan's arrogance, that all things dared
So that the king was with his kingdom crushed
Out of her senses like a dog she barked
So much the anguish had her mind distorted
Were ever seen in any one so cruel
As I beheld two shadows pale and naked
Who, biting, in the manner ran along
That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose
One to Capocchio came, and by the nape
Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging
It made his belly grate the solid bottom
Said to me: That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi
And raving goes thus harrying other people
Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee
To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence
She came to sin with him after this manner
As he who goeth yonder undertook
That he might gain the lady of the herd
Making a will and giving it due form
And after the two maniacs had passed
On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back
To look upon the other evil-born
I saw one made in fashion of a lute
If he had only had the groin cut off
Just at the point at which a man is forked
The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts
That the face corresponds not to the belly
Compelled him so to hold his lips apart
As does the hectic, who because of thirst
One tow'rds the chin, the other upward turns
O ye, who without any torment are
And why I know not, in the world of woe
Making their channels to be cold and moist
For far more doth their image dry me up
Than the disease which strips my face of flesh
The rigid justice that chastises me
I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight
The currency imprinted with the Baptist
For which I left my body burned above
But if I here could see the tristful soul
For Branda's fount I would not give the sight
Shades that are going round about speak truth
But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?
A hundred years I could advance one inch
I had already started on the way
Seeking him out among this squalid folk
Although the circuit be eleven miles
And be not less than half a mile across
They did induce me into coining florins
Which had three carats of impurity
And I to him: Who are the two poor wretches
Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?
Into this chasm, and since they have not turned
Nor do I think they will for evermore
One the false woman is who accused Joseph
From acute fever they send forth such reek
At being, peradventure, named so darkly
Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch
It gave a sound, as if it were a drum
And Master Adam smote him in the face
With arm that did not seem to be less hard
I have an arm unfettered for such need
Whereat he answer made: When thou didst go
But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining
Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy
If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin
Said Sinon; and for one fault I am here
Remember, perjurer, about the horse
He made reply who had the swollen belly
And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it
Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks
Thy tongue, the Greek said, and the putrid water
Then the false-coiner: So is gaping wide
Thy mouth for speaking evil, as 'tis wont
Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me
Thou hast the burning and the head that aches
And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus
Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee
When him I heard in anger speak to me
I turned me round towards him with such shame
That still it eddies through my memory
And as he is who dreams of his own harm
Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream
Such I became, not having power to speak
Less shame doth wash away a greater fault
The Master said, than this of thine has been
And make account that I am aye beside thee
If e'er it come to pass that fortune bring thee
For a base wish it is to wish to hear it
One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me
So that it tinged the one cheek and the other
And then held out to me the medicine
Thus do I hear that once Achilles' spear
His and his father's, used to be the cause
We turned our backs upon the wretched valley
Upon the bank that girds it round about
Going across it without any speech
So that my sight went little in advance
But I could hear the blare of a loud horn
So loud it would have made each thunder faint
Which, counter to it following its way
Mine eyes directed wholly to one place
When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost
Short while my head turned thitherward I held
When many lofty towers I seemed to see
Whereat I: Master, say, what town is this?
It happens that thou errest in thy fancy
Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there
How much the sense deceives itself by distance
Then tenderly he took me by the hand
That the reality may seem to thee
Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants
As, when the fog is vanishing away
Whate'er the mist that crowds the air conceals
So, piercing through the dense and darksome air
More and more near approaching tow'rd the verge
My error fled, and fear came over me
Montereggione crowns itself with towers
E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well
With one half of their bodies turreted
The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces
E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders
And I of one already saw the face
Certainly Nature, when she left the making
Of animals like these, did well indeed
By taking such executors from Mars
And if of elephants and whales she doth not
Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly
Is added unto evil will and power
No rampart can the people make against it
His face appeared to me as long and large
Down from the middle, showed so much of him
Above it, that to reach up to his hair
For I beheld thirty great palms of him
Began to clamour the ferocious mouth
To which were not befitting sweeter psalms
Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that
When wrath or other passion touches thee
Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt
Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul
And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast
Then said to me: He doth himself accuse
This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought
One language in the world is not still used
As his to others, which to none is known
Therefore a longer journey did we make
Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft
In binding him, who might the master be
With chains, that held him so begirt about
From the neck down, that on the part uncovered
It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre
This proud one wished to make experiment
My Leader said, whence he has such a guerdon
Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess
What time the giants terrified the gods
The arms he wielded never more he moves
These eyes of mine might have experience
Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us
And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one
Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious
That it could shake a tower so violently
If I had not beheld the manacles
Then we proceeded farther in advance
And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells
Without the head, forth issued from the cavern
Which Scipio the heir of glory made
When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts
And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war
Among thy brothers, some it seems still think
The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:
There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up
This one can give of that which here is longed for
Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip
Still in the world can he restore thy fame
Because he lives, and still expects long life
So said the Master; and in haste the other
His hands extended and took up my Guide,--
Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt
Then of himself and me one bundle made
Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud
I could have wished to go some other way
But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up
If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous
Down upon which thrust all the other rocks
I would press out the juice of my conception
Not without fear I bring myself to speak
For 'tis no enterprise to take in jest
To sketch the bottom of all the universe
Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo
But may those Ladies help this verse of mine
That from the fact the word be not diverse
Who're in the place to speak of which is hard
'Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!
And I was scanning still the lofty wall
I heard it said to me: Look how thou steppest!
Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet
And underfoot a lake, that from the frost
The semblance had of glass, and not of water
So thick a veil ne'er made upon its current
E'en at the edge 'twould not have given a creak
And as to croak the frog doth place himself
With muzzle out of water,--when is dreaming
Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,--
Livid, as far down as where shame appears
Were the disconsolate shades within the ice
Setting their teeth unto the note of storks
Each one his countenance held downward bent
Among them witness of itself procures
The hair upon their heads together mingled
Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me
I said, who are you; and they bent their necks
And when to me their faces they had lifted
Their eyes, which first were only moist within
Gushed o'er the eyelids, and the frost congealed
The tears between, and locked them up again
Clamp never bound together wood with wood
So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats
Butted together, so much wrath o'ercame them
And one, who had by reason of the cold
Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward
Said: Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?
The valley whence Bisenzio descends
Belonged to them and to their father Albert
They from one body came, and all Caina
Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade
More worthy to be fixed in gelatine
Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow
So with his head I see no farther forward
And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni
Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan
And that thou put me not to further speech
Then I beheld a thousand faces, made
Purple with cold; whence o'er me comes a shudder
And evermore will come, at frozen ponds
And while we were advancing tow'rds the middle
Where everything of weight unites together
And I was shivering in the eternal shade
I know not; but in walking 'mong the heads
I struck my foot hard in the face of one
Weeping he growled: Why dost thou trample me?
Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance
That I through him may issue from a doubt
Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish
The Leader stopped; and to that one I said
Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?
Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora
Smiting, replied he, other people's cheeks
That 'mid the other notes thy name I place
Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble
For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow
Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him
And said: It must needs be thou name thyself
Or not a hair remain upon thee here
Whence he to me: Though thou strip off my hair
I had his hair in hand already twisted
And more than one shock of it had pulled out
He barking, with his eyes held firmly down
When cried another: What doth ail thee, Bocca?
Is't not enough to clatter with thy jaws
But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?
Now, said I, I care not to have thee speak
I will report of thee veracious news
Begone, replied he, and tell what thou wilt
But be not silent, if thou issue hence
Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt
He weepeth here the silver of the French
'I saw,' thus canst thou phrase it, 'him of Duera
There where the sinners stand out in the cold
If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there
Who oped Faenza when the people slep
When I beheld two frozen in one hole
And even as bread through hunger is devoured
The uppermost on the other set his teeth
There where the brain is to the nape united
Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed
Than that one did the skull and the other things
Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating
In knowing who ye are, and his transgression
I in the world above repay thee for it
If that wherewith I speak be not dried up
His mouth uplifted from his grim repast
That sinner, wiping it upon the hair
Of the same head that he behind had wasted
The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already
But if my words be seed that may bear fruit
Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw
Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together
I know not who thou art, nor by what mode
Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine
Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee
Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino
Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour
Trusting in him I was made prisoner
And after put to death, I need not say
 But ne'ertheless what thou canst not have heard
That is to say, how cruel was my death
Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me
Which bears because of me the title of Famine
And in which others still must be locked up
Had shown me through its opening many moons
Already, when I dreamed the evil dream
This one appeared to me as lord and master
Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain
With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained
He had sent out before him to the front
After brief course seemed unto me forespent
It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open
Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons
Who with me were, and asking after bread
Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not
Thinking of what my heart foreboded me
And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?
They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh
At which our food used to be brought to us
And I heard locking up the under door
I gazed into the faces of my sons
I wept not, I within so turned to stone
They wept; and darling little Anselm mine
Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?
Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made
Until another sun rose on the world
As now a little glimmer made its way
Into the dolorous prison, and I saw
Upon four faces my own very aspect
Both of my hands in agony I bit
And, thinking that I did it from desire
And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us
If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us
With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off
Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?
When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo
Threw himself down outstretched before my feet
Saying, 'My father, why dost thou not help me?
I saw the three fall, one by one, between
The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me
And three days called them after they were dead
Then hunger did what sorrow could not do
When he had said this, with his eyes distorted
The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth
Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are
Let the Capraia and Gorgona move
And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno
That every person in thee it may drown!
For if Count Ugolino had the fame
Of having in thy castles thee betrayed
Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons
Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata
We passed still farther onward, where the ice
Another people ruggedly enswathes
And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes
Turns itself inward to increase the anguish
Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full
Its station had abandoned in my face
Still it appeared to me I felt some wind
Whence I: My Master, who sets this in motion?
Is not below here every vapour quenched?
Whence he to me: Full soon shalt thou be where
Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this
Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast
Cried out to us: O souls so merciless
That the last post is given unto you
May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart
May I go to the bottom of the ice
Who here a date am getting for my fig
O, said I to him, now art thou, too, dead?
And he to me: How may my body fare
Up in the world, no knowledge I possess
Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea
That oftentimes the soul descendeth here
Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it
Know that as soon as any soul betrays
As I have done, his body by a demon
Until his time has wholly been revolved
Itself down rushes into such a cistern
And still perchance above appears the body
This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down
I think, said I to him, thou dost deceive me
And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes
In moat above, said he, of Malebranche
There where is boiling the tenacious pitch
When this one left a devil in his stead
Who made together with him the betrayal
But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith
Open mine eyes;--and open them I did not
Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?
I found of you one such, who for his deeds
And still above in body seems alive!
Towards us; therefore look in front of thee
My Master said, if thou discernest him
As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when
Our hemisphere is darkening into night
Appears far off a mill the wind is turning
Methought that such a building then I saw
And, for the wind, I drew myself behind
My Guide, because there was no other shelter
Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it
There where the shades were wholly covered up
And glimmered through like unto straws in glass
Some prone are lying, others stand erect
When in advance so far we had proceeded
The creature who once had the beauteous semblance
Saying: Behold Dis, and behold the place
Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself
Because all language would be insufficient
Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit
From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice
And better with a giant I compare
Than do the giants with those arms of his
Which unto such a part conforms itself
And lifted up his brow against his Maker
Well may proceed from him all tribulation
O, what a marvel it appeared to me
When I beheld three faces on his head!
Two were the others, that were joined with this
And they were joined together at the crest
And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow
The left was such to look upon as those
Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward
Underneath each came forth two mighty wings
Sails of the sea I never saw so large
 No feathers had they, but as of a bat
Their fashion was; and he was waving them
So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom
With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins
At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching
Utterly stripped of all the skin remained
That soul up there which has the greatest pain
With head inside, he plies his legs without
Of the two others, who head downward are
The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus
See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word
And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius
But night is reascending, and 'tis time
That we depart, for we have seen the whole
As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck
And he the vantage seized of time and place
And when the wings were opened wide apart
He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides
When we were come to where the thigh revolves
The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath
Turned round his head where he had had his legs
And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts
Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these
Must we perforce depart from so much evil
Then through the opening of a rock he issued
And down upon the margin seated me
Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step
I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see
Lucifer in the same way I had left him
And I beheld him upward hold his legs
Let stolid people think who do not see
What the point is beyond which I had passed
Rise up, the Master said, upon thy feet
The way is long, and difficult the road
There where we were, but dungeon natural
Ere from the abyss I tear myself away
To draw me from an error speak a little
Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed
From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?
Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped
The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world
That side thou wast, so long as I descended
When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point
And now beneath the hemisphere art come
Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death
The Man who without sin was born and lived
Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere
Which makes the other face of the Judecca
Here it is morn when it is evening there
And he who with his hair a stairway made us
Still fixed remaineth as he was before
Upon this side he fell down out of heaven
And all the land, that whilom here emerged
For fear of him made of the sea a veil
And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure
To flee from him, what on this side appears
Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled
A place there is below, from Beelzebub
As far receding as the tomb extends
Which not by sight is known, but by the sound
Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth
Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed
With course that winds about and slightly falls
Now entered, to return to the bright world
And without care of having any rest
Till I beheld through a round aperture
Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars
